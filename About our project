Traffic violations have become a common and occuring daily, often going unpunished due to the absence of traffic authorities at the 
scene. This lack of immediate enforcement allows offenders to escape accountability, increasing the risk of dangerous incidents that could otherwise be 
avoided. Addressing this gap in traffic law enforcement is critical to ensuring safer roads and fostering a more responsible driving culture.

Our proposed solution is an innovative mobile application designed to empower citizens to take an active role in traffic safety. With this app, 
any responsible individual can act as an extension of the law enforcement system by capturing instances of traffic violations in real-time. Whether it’s 
illegal parking, speeding, running a red light, or any other traffic infraction, users can quickly snap a photograph of the violation and upload it directly 
through the application. The submitted report would then undergo a verification process by the relevant authorities to ensure authenticity and accuracy.

Once the violation is validated, the authorities can levy the appropriate fine on the offender. What sets this solution apart is the integration of a citizen 
reward system: individuals who report confirmed violations would receive a percentage of the fine as a token of appreciation for their active contribution to public
safety. This not only incentivizes citizens to be more vigilant but also helps to create a culture where traffic rules are adhered to more strictly, knowing that 
every individual has the power to hold violators accountable.

This approach bridges the gap between law enforcement and the general public, making it easier to curb violations in real-time. Additionally, it enhances civic 
responsibility, encouraging people to take part in keeping their communities safer. By allowing everyday citizens to actively participate in traffic law enforcement, 
we can significantly reduce the number of unchecked violations, decrease traffic-related accidents, and make our roads safer for everyone.

In summary, our application serves as a powerful tool for improving traffic compliance, while also promoting community engagement and accountability. By providing 
both a mechanism for immediate reporting and a reward system, this initiative ensures that every road user is held responsible for their actions, ultimately leading to
safer and more disciplined driving behavior.
