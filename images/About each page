1. Home Page:
Purpose: The central landing point of the app. Users typically start their journey from here.
Features: It could show the basic navigation to other parts of the app, like the camera (upload), previews, 
and status updates. This page likely serves as the entry point for users to interact with the app.

2. Upload Page:
Purpose: This is where the user opens the camera and captures a photo.
Features: It would have a camera interface with a capture button. After capturing a photo, the image is not 
immediately saved but is passed to the next page for review.

3. Preview Page:
Purpose: To let users see the photo they captured and decide whether to keep it.
Features: The captured image is displayed, along with the GPS location at the bottom. Users can either save
the image to their device or discard it. Only upon clicking 'Save' will the image be stored on the device.

4. Status Page:
Purpose: This page could be where users view the status of uploads or stored photos.
Features: It might display a list of photos the user has saved, along with any associated data (like GPS 
location or upload status). This page might also handle displaying progress for uploads when the app includes 
a cloud upload feature in the future.
